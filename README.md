# Example WordPress Composer

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/pantheon-systems/example-wordpress-composer.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/pantheon-systems/example-wordpress-composer)

This repository is a start state for a Composer-based WordPress workflow with Pantheon. It is meant to be copied by the the [Terminus Build Tools Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin) which will set up for you a brand new

* GitHub repo
* Free Pantheon sandbox site
* A CircleCI configuration to run tests and push from the source repo (GitHub) to Pantheon.

For more background information on this style of workflow, see the [Pantheon documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/github-pull-requests/).


## Installation

#### Prerequisites

Before running the `terminus build:project:create` command, make sure you have all of the prerequisites:

* [A Pantheon account](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/register)
* [Terminus, the Pantheon command line tool](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/install/)
* [The Terminus Build Tools Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin)
* An account with GitHub and an authentication token capable of creating new repos.
* An account with CircleCI and an authentication token.

You may find it easier to export the GitHub and CircleCI tokens as variables on your command line where the Build Tools Plugin can detect them automatically:

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=[REDACTED]
export CIRCLE_TOKEN=[REDACTED]
```

#### One command setup:

Once you have all of the prerequisites in place, you can create your copy of this repo with one command:

```
terminus build:project:create pantheon-systems/example-wordpress-composer my-new-site --team="Agency Org Name"
```

The parameters shown here are:

* The name of the source repo, `pantheon-systems/example-wordpress-composer`. If you are interest in other source repos like Drupal 8, see the [Terminus Build Tools Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin).
* The machine name to be used by both the soon-to-be-created Pantheon site and GitHub repo. Change `my-new-site` to something meaningful for you.
* The `--team` flag is optional and refers to a Pantheon organization. Pantheon organizations are often web development agencies or Universities. Setting this parameter causes the newly created site to go within the given organization. Run the Terminus command `terminus org:list` to see the organizations you are a member of. There might not be any.

#### PHP Version

You will need PHP 7.0 or higher locally to run the `build:project:create` command as some of the dependencies in this project require it. Both `composer.json` and `pantheon.yml` are currently set to use PHP 7.0.

## Important files and directories

#### `/web`

Pantheon will serve the site from the `/web` subdirectory due to the configuration in `pantheon.yml`, facilitating a Composer based workflow. Having your website in this subdirectory also allows for tests, scripts, and other files related to your project to be stored in your repo without polluting your web document root.

#### `/web/wp`

Even within the `/web` directory you may notice that other directories and files are in different places [compared to a default WordPress installation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory). See `/web/wp-config.php` for key settings like `WP_SITEURL` which allows WordPress core to be relocated to `/web/wp`. The overall layout of directories in the repo is inspired by [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock).

#### `composer.json`

If you are just browsing this repository on GitHub, you may not see some of the directories mentioned above like `wp-admin`. That is because WordPress core and its plugins are installed via Composer and ignored in the `.gitignore` file. Specific plugins are added to the project via `composer.json` and `composer.lock` keeps track of the exact version of each plugin (or other dependency). Generic Composer dependencies (not WordPress plugins or themes) are downloaded to the `/vendor` folder. Use the `require` section for any dependencies you wish to push to Pantheon, even those that might only be used on non-Live environments. Dependencies added in `require-dev` such as `php_codesniffer` or `phpunit` will not be pushed to Pantheon by the CI scripts.

## Behat tests

So that CircleCI will have some test to run, this repository includes a configuration of [WordHat](https://wordhat.info/), A WordPress Behat extension. You can add your own `.feature` files within `/tests/behat/features`. [A fuller guide on WordPress testing with Behat is forthcoming.](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/issues/2469)

## Working locally with Lando
To get started using Lando to develop locally complete these one-time steps. Please note than Lando is an independent product and is not supported by Pantheon. For further assistance please refer to the [Lando documentation](https://docs.devwithlando.io/).

* [Install Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/installation/installing.html), if not already installed.
* Clone this repository locally.
* Run `lando init` and follow the prompts, choosing the Pantheon recipe followed by entering a valid machine token and selecting the Pantheon site created by [the Terminus build tools plugin].(https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin).
* Run `lando start` to start Lando.
    - Save the local site URL. It should be similar to `https://<PROJECT_NAME>.lndo.site`.
* Run `lando composer install --no-ansi --no-interaction --optimize-autoloader --no-progress` to download dependencies
* Run `lando pull --code=none` to download the media files and database from Pantheon.
* Visit the local site URL saved from above.

You should now be able to edit your site locally. The steps above do not need to be completed on subsequent starts. You can stop Lando with `lando stop` and start it again with `lando start`.

**Warning:** do NOT push/pull code between Lando and Pantheon directly. All code should be pushed to GitHub and deployed to Pantheon through a continuous integration service, such as CircleCI.

Composer, Terminus and wp-cli commands should be run in Lando rather than on the host machine. This is done by prefixing the desired command with `lando`. For example, after a change to `composer.json` run `lando composer update` rather than `composer update`.
